The law restricts or prohibits specific breeds of dogs since they are considered as vicious or dangerous. Breeds like Fila Brasileiros and Pit Bulls rank on the list of banned dogs in the world.</p><h2>What dog breeds are illegal?</h2><p class=align-left>About 53 countries, including the United States of America, Australia, the United Kingdom, and South <a href=#>Africa</a>, have <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">jurisdictions with breed-specific laws</a>. Forty-two out of those countries have enacted the breed-specific legislation at the national level. Let us consider 12 of the most illegal dog breeds in the world and why they are not allowed.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>List of illegal pets in South Africa</p><h3>1. Fila Brasileiro</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/a4caa5f5d93a1adc.jpg><p class=align-left>They are also called the Brazilian mastiffs. The breed is popular for their tracking ability, intelligence, aggressiveness, and unforgiving temperament. Because of these, they serve as a guard dog, hunting dog for tracking, and are also used for controlling large games.</p><p class=align-left>However, courts in Malta, Norway, Denmark, Israel, the UK, and Cyprus exempt this breed of dogs from being owned. Also, the Fila is a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">restricted or proscribed</a> breed in Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales, and Queensland. New Zealand, Trinidad & Tobago classify them as a dangerous dog, which means no one can import them. Males must also be neutered.</p><h3>2. Pit bull</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/30a6eecfa2cff941.jpg><p class=align-left>In the United States, the term is used for dogs that descend from bulldogs and terriers. In other countries like the UK, it is an abbreviation of the American pit bull terrier breed. They have been used as police dogs, war dogs, actors, <a href=#>celebrity</a> pets, and search and rescue dogs. They are strong, energetic, agile, and powerful, and they respond well to training.</p><p class=align-left>However, according to a study, pit bulls were responsible for 42% to 45% of dog attacks with children being the victim 70% of the time. Consequently, they are restricted in most parts of the world.</p><h3>3. Neapolitan mastiff</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/1bd636718a6e389c.jpg><p class=align-left>Also called Mastino Napoletano, this breed is massive, large, and powerful. The body's length is about 15% greater than its height. However, it is perceived as being dangerous or even a threat to society. It is illegal to own this breed in Singapore, and for anyone who wishes to keep one in Romania, a Neapolitan mastiff must conduct a psychological evaluation on them.</p><h3>4. Dogo Argentino</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/05014ce45ba0c0af.jpg><p class=align-left>Dogo Argentino is a large, white, muscular breed of dog that was developed primarily for big-game hunting in Argentina. They are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">intelligent and courageous</a>, and they have an instinct to protect their home and family.</p><p class=align-left>So, why is Dogo Argentino banned? It is due to its strong and dominating temperament. Someone new to dog raising is not even advised to own this breed. Some countries, including Australia, Spain, Great Britain, Romania, Norway, United States, Bermuda Islands, and Singapore, have either <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">restricted or banned</a> their citizens from keeping them.</p><h3>5. Tosa Inu</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/f84254ab20fbb5a5.jpg><p class=align-left>This breed is raised as a fighting dog. Even though some countries have restricted people from owning them because it is classified under dangerous dog breeds, Japan still uses it in dogfighting. Are Tosa Inu dangerous?

In Spanish, the breed means Canarian catch dog. This dog is usually large, and it has a thick and muscular body. They need to be <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">trained early</a> for them to socialise and obey.</p><p class=align-left>Is Presa Canario dangerous?

Boerboel breeding is both a hobby and an industry in South Africa. These dogs are now exported from South Africa to other parts of the world. Boerboels are intelligent and energetic and can be loyal and protective of their family and territory.</p><p class=align-left>Nevertheless, if left isolated, they can digress and end up becoming destructive. How dangerous is a Boerboel? Although it rarely bites a person, when it attacks, it can easily<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> tear through muscle</a>, tendons and, in some cases, bone. Countries like Malaysia, Mauritius, Qatar, Bermuda, France, Romania, and Tunisia have either banned, prohibited or restricted the breed.</p><h3>9.

The reason is that they use it mainly to herd livestock and pull carts laden with butchered meat to market. Their guarding and genetic herding instincts are superb. Still, if their owners are not responsible enough or they neglect, abuse and do not train them well, they could exhibit dangerous behaviour.</p><p class=align-left>Why are Rottweilers banned? Although debatable, some people are concerned that this variety of dogs are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">bred to attack</a> and that their owners may not be able to control them adequately.

Staffordshire bull terrier</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/337758738fffb176.jpg><p class=align-left>This breed is possibly is one of the most <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">famous companion dog</a> breeds in France, Australia, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand.

Cane Corso</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/17ba274750858b11.jpg><p class=align-left>This variety is an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Italian breed of a mastiff</a>.
