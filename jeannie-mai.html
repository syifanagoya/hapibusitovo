Olivia married her second husband, Ted, without informing her children, which surprised Jeannie and her siblings. Eight years later, the truth came to light when Jeannie found out that Uncle Ted was their stepfather.</p><p>Olivia and Ted’s relationship started in a chat room for single Vietnamese. After talking online for four months, they met in Houston, where they instantly clicked. They eventually got married, but they kept the news from their children, not knowing how they would react. Jeannie only learned about it eight years later and was happy for her mother.</p><p>However, their relationship was not always smooth sailing. Jeannie experienced abuse from a family member from nine until she was sixteen or seventeen. When she told her mother about it, Olivia didn’t believe her, which led to Jeannie running away from home when she was only sixteen. The two didn’t reconcile for eight years until Jeannie was twenty-four.</p><p>After their reconciliation, Jeannie explained everything to her mother, who then confronted Jeannie’s abuser.</p><h3 class="kt-adv-heading_0602d8-50 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading" data-kb-block=kb-adv-heading_0602d8-50>James Mai</h3><p>Jeannie Mai’s father, James Mai, was Chinese, and her mother, Olivia, ran away with him at a young age due to her father’s mistreatment of her.
