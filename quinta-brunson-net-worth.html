In her book, Quinta referred to her mother as a "dedicated and brilliant kindergarten teacher," and during an appearance on "The <a href=# title="Kelly Clarkson Net Worth">Kelly Clarkson</a> Show" to promote "Abbot Elementary," she revealed, "I was in my mother's class, her kindergarten class. I was in her class and I went to the same school where she taught for like six years, including kindergarten. So I rode to school with her, rode home with her, watched her work more at home. It's just getting such a different view. And I really credit my mom's experience for helping me to create the show." As a child, Brunson was very energetic, which led her mother to enroll her in ballet and aerobics classes. Quinta studied at the Charter High School for Architecture & Design and became "obsessed" with comedy as a teenager, which inspired her to take an improv class.
