She was born Orpah Gail Winfrey on January 29, 1954. She is best known for her Chicago-based talk show, The Oprah Winfrey Show, which aired from 1986 to 2011 and was nationally syndicated for 25 years. [better&nbsp;source&nbsp;needed] She was known as the “Queen of All Media,” the richest black American of the 20th century, the only black billionaire at one point, and the most influential black philanthropist in American history. She was occasionally rated as the most powerful woman in the world in 2007.</p><p>Winfrey was raised in the inner city of Milwaukee after being born into poverty to a single, teenage mother in rural Mississippi. She has claimed that she was abused as a child and in her early adolescence. She got pregnant at the age of 14, and her son was born prematurely and died in infancy.</p><p>After being sent to live with Vernon Winfrey, a barber who she refers to as her father, in Nashville, Tennessee, Winfrey found work in radio while still a high school student. By the age of 19, she was a co-anchor for the neighborhood evening news. Winfrey transitioned to the daytime talk show industry as a result of her frequently emotional, impromptu delivery. She then established her own production company after elevating a third-rated local Chicago talk show to the top spot.</p><p>By the middle of the 1990s, Winfrey had changed the direction of her program, emphasizing literature, personal development, mindfulness, and spirituality. She has received criticism for encouraging a confessional culture, endorsing dubious self-help concepts, and taking an emotion-focused approach, but she has also received praise for overcoming hardship to help others. With her endorsement of Barack Obama estimated to have been worth about one million votes during the 2008 Democratic primary, Winfrey also became a political force in the race for the presidency in 2008.</p><p>President Obama presented Winfrey with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013, and Harvard and Duke both bestowed honorary doctorates upon her. She established the Oprah Winfrey Network in 2008 as her own network (OWN).</p><p>Phil Donahue’s tabloid talk show genre, which Winfrey popularised and transformed, is credited with inventing a more personal and candid style of media communication.</p><p>She was admitted to the National Women’s Hall of Fame in 1994.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Oprah (@oprah)</a></p><p>Throughout her career, Winfrey has received numerous honors, including 18 Daytime Emmy Awards, the Chairman’s Award for Lifetime Achievement, two Primetime Emmy Awards, the Bob Hope Humanitarian Award, a Tony Award, a Peabody Award, the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award from the Academy Awards, and two more Academy Award nominations. In 2021, Winfrey was chosen to join the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p><h2>Oprah Winfrey Early Life and Education</h2><p>On January 29, 1954, Oprah Gail Winfrey was born on a farm near Kosciusko, Mississippi. Vernita Lee and Vernon Winfrey were her parents; they divorced not long after she was born. She was raised by her maternal grandmother. She was a precocious child who, according to some accounts, started reading as early as age two and a half. She relocated to Milwaukee when she was six years old, settling in a very underprivileged area.</p><p>At age 12, she later relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, where her father would raise her. She later visited her mother’s house in the city of Milwaukee as a teenager. Winfrey has spoken about the physical and sexual violence she experienced while growing up in Milwaukee. Throughout her teenage years, she alternated between the residences of her parents.</p><p>Despite her difficulties, Winfrey attributes her development into a responsible and educated young woman to her father’s stern direction and commitment to study. Because of her academic excellence, she received a full scholarship at Tennessee State University. At university, she received numerous honors, including an invitation to a White House youth conference, the title of Miss Fire Prevention, a job reading newscasts at a nearby radio station, and titles of Miss Tennesse and Miss Black Nashville.</p><p>Winfrey began her career in television at WLAC-TV (now WTVF), a CBS station in Nashville, Tennessee, when she was 19 years old. She moved to Baltimore, Maryland’s ABC station WJZ-TV in 1976. However, she migrated to a brand-new morning chat program called People Are Talking in 1977 after finding it difficult to retain the objectivity needed to present news.</p><p>Winfrey was able to establish a relationship with her guests because of her informal, impromptu approach, which made it easy for them to share their personal tales. By the end of the decade, the program outperformed Phil Donahue’s show in the local ratings.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Oprah (@oprah)</a></p><h2>Oprah Winfrey’s Husband and Personal Life</h2><p>Oprah Winfrey was sexually abused as a youngster and lived in poverty her entire life. She has made it her life’s work as an adult to better the lives of girls and women who have also experienced abuse, to aid children and families in escaping poverty, and to promote educational initiatives both domestically and overseas, particularly in South Africa.</p><p>Due to her own history of abuse, Winfrey launched a campaign in 1991 to create a nationwide database of child abusers to assist people who had been harmed. The National Child Protection Act’s centerpiece, “Oprah’s Bill,” which established a national register of convicted child abusers, was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in December 1993.</p><p>Oprah Winfrey is not married and has no children, but she has been dating Stedman Graham for more than 30 years. Graham is an author, business executive, and teacher.</p><h2>Oprah Winfrey’s Age</h2><p>Oprah Winfrey is 68 years old.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6y1sHnIrGSoqKKWtW7DyKedq52pZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./phillip-gandey-death.html>&#171;&nbsp;Gandey Circus Phillip Gandey Death And Obituary: Family Mourns The Loss</a>
