For this reason, people try everything in their power to solve the problems that we go through. Every now and then, we will always face challenges that put us to the test. Sometimes, the problems that we go through are small, and we hardly notice them. It is until we are given solutions to our problems do we notice that what we are going through is a challenge. As much as we would like to say that we are tough enough to handle everything, sometimes getting a little help does not hurt.</p><p>As long as we are alive, we will always face challenges here and there. Sometimes, if not all the time, finding the solution to these problems proves to be a huge challenge. A solution might be just around the corner, but sometimes getting to it proves to be a big challenge. Brainstorming is quite important if you find yourself in a situation where you need a solution for a big challenge. Sometimes the solution might come on its own from anywhere, and surprisingly, the solution is not a big thing as you might have thought earlier, sometimes, it just needs a simple fix.</p><p>Such situations brought the birth of Spatty and her big brother, Spatty Daddy. This was the inventions of Cheryl Rigdon, who got tired of throwing away remainder products in her makeup and lotion containers, considering that the products were quite expensive.</p><h2>Inception</h2><p>Suffering from one problem for the rest of our lives is a burden that no one is willing to carry around, for this reason, people decide to get innovative for the purpose of solving their issues. A good example of such circumstances is like that of Cheryl Rigdon. This lady got tired of being unable to reach the product at the bottom of her expensive bottles of make-up and lotion. It is for this reason that she decided to put her mind to the test and find the solution to her problem. She did this by trying to make a make-shift tool that you can use to get the remaining product in any bottle or container. After a lot of brainstorming, she came up with the Spatty.</p><p>The Spatty is a small spatula-like tool that she eventually came up with. The Spatty proved to be a huge success and decided to take the simple invention to a new level. She decided to make the bold move and try to pitch the idea to the show, Shark Tank. She prepped herself quite well and also quite a lot of research on her own.</p><p>Before pitching the idea to Shark Tank, she tried selling the product on E-bay. She was able to sell eleven of them, and she received a lot of positive feedback. Making the actual product was not a challenge since her husband worked as a project manager at a factory. Therefore she was not overwhelmed in making the actual product that good enough to go to the market.</p><p>When Cheryl went to pitch her idea at the Shark Tank, she got some positive feedback from the entrepreneurs. They were actually amazed by the idea because she found the solution to a problem that everyone ignored. All she needed to set up her business idea quite well was about $50,000. Cheryl was quite lucky after the show that she received some mentorship from Daymond. Later on, Cheryl was also able to make a bigger version of the Spatty, which could be used for bigger containers such as paint cans in the garage and also some items in the kitchen.</p><h2>Evolution</h2><p>Cheryl’s brilliant idea received a lot of positive feedback, not only from the panel of entrepreneurs but also the viewers of the show. Shortly after the show, Cheryl received a lot of requests from fans who wanted to have the product. Cheryl went on to have a lot of success in the coming years. She had a Master’s Degree in Speech Pathology with an undergraduate degree in Special Education, and she had worked in that field for many years. After the success of her invention, she pays all her attention to the growth and running of Spatty.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Spatty Daddy was a simple solution to a small problem that erupted into a business success. Cheryl has shockingly been able to turn heads and has gotten people thinking. Apart from that, she is also known for her big heart. She never hesitates when help is needed somewhere. It is her drive to help people with similar problems that pushed her to invest in the idea which later on erupted with success. Although at the moment, she does not have any awards, it is certain that sooner or later, she will be awarded for her great work.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Spatty Daddy in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Spatty-Daddy-Net-Worth.jpg><p>As of July 2024, The estimated net worth of Spatty Daddy is more than $4 million.
